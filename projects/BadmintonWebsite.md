I am in the process of creating a revamped "Honolulu Badminton Club" website! This new website will include hours of operation, what drinks are available for purchase, information about the gym, pricing of shuttlecocks/membership, and so much more! I have acquired permission from one of the people that run the gym to update the website a long time ago, so now is the perfect time.

Badminton has always been more than just a sport for me; it's a profound passion that fuels both my body and mind. The swift, graceful movements on the court, the satisfying sound of the shuttlecock hitting tour racket, and the strategic play of offense and defense creates so much excitement and a challenge. Every match is a chance to push my limits, sharpen my reflexes, and experience the pure joy of athleticism and competition. Whether Iâ€™m practicing solo, perfecting my technique, or engaging in intense rallies with friends, badminton captivates me with its blend of physical rigor and mental agility, making each game a new opportunity to excel and enjoy the essence of the sport.

https://honolulubadminton.com/ is the current website.
